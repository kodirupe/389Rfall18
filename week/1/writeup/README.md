### Part 2 (75 pts)

I should definitely tell my boss. If this is before the car is released it is not necessay to tell the public. The public is not in danger as of yet and the problem can be fixed before there is any potential danger. It would be extremely unethical to not tell anyone because it puts many people's lives at risk. Some may argue that by telling someone it could cost the company money and it should not be done. This is wrong because firstly, telling someone about the issue doesn't cost the company any money, and secondly this puts many peoples lives in danger which is very wrong and unethical. If the company is unwilling to postpone the ECU's release then i should tell the public or some consumer watchdog that would inform the public. I would most likely get in trouble with the company, and very likely legal trouble for releasing this information. However, many people's lives would be in danger if I do not tell anyone and not only is it very wrong to gain more money at the expense of people's lives, it would be a very heavy burden on the conscience. At least if the public knows about it, they can make the decision whether or not they want to risk their life buying the car. Some may make the argument that this would hurt the company by costing them much time, effort, and money, and that this is also hurting people too. However, this is wrong. This would be a financial burden on the company but it is not worth it to put people's lives in danger. Also, if the malfunction were to become very prevelant, the company could be scrutinized, and gain a bad reputation. If i were to do nothing, I would be partly responsible for the harm that results. I would be responsible because I found the security flaw, and made a conscious decision to not inform anyone. If I had informed someone, then the issue could've potentially been resolved. This is especially true, if I am the only one that works on the security firmware. The argument could be made that I would not be responsible because someone else could've found the flaw and reported it. This is wrong because I am part of a team, and we would all be responsible, and that includes me.
